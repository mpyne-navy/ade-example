1. _Purpose_. To establish policy and requirements for Navy’s
Physical Readiness Program to ensure both Active Component (AC)
and Reserve Component (RC) personnel maintain a level of
physical fitness required to support overall mission readiness
per reference (a) through (k).
2. _Cancellation_.  OPNAVINST 6110.1H.
3. _Scope_. This instruction applies to all AC and RC Navy
personnel, commands, and activities.
    1. This instruction describes the Navy’s Physical Readiness
Program, issues program requirements, defines the
responsibilities for compliance, and establishes required
minimum standards of physical fitness.
    2. The Physical Readiness Program Operating Guide is the
official Physical Readiness Program supplement guide to the this
instruction and will be referred to as the Operating Guide
throughout this instruction. All information contained within
the guide is available for download on the Physical Readiness
Program Web site:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/physical/Pages/default2.aspx.
The Operating Guide is divided into three sections:
        1. Physical Readiness Program “How To” Guide;
        2. Command Fitness and Fitness Enhancement Program
(FEP) Guide; and
        3. Physical Readiness Program Nutrition Resource Guide.
4. _Discussion_. It has become increasingly important for all
Navy personnel to maintain a minimum prescribed level of
physical fitness necessary for world-wide deployment, whenever
or wherever needed. Per reference (b), the Navy utilizes a
holistic approach to overall wellness via exercise, nutrition,
weight control, tobacco cessation, prevention of alcohol abuse,
and health and wellness education. While all of these factors
contribute to overall wellness, the primary focus of this
instruction is to define the policies and requirements for both
maintaining and assessing Navy physical fitness.
5. _Policy_. All Navy AC and RC personnel shall meet minimum
physical fitness standards for continued naval service.
    1. Command Physical Training (PT) Program. Commanding
officers (COs) are responsible and accountable for the physical
fitness of their personnel and shall establish and maintain an
effective year-round physical readiness program. Physical
fitness shall be integrated into the workweek, consistent with
mission and operational requirements. To maintain health and
decrease the risk of chronic disease:
        1. Members shall comply with medical screening
requirements for participation in all physical training
consistent with this instruction.
        2. Members should participate in moderate activity at
least:
            1. Two hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) per week,
i.e., 50 minutes three times per week or 75 minutes two times
per week; plus
            2. Perform strength training exercises at least
twice per week to work all major muscle groups.
        3. Detailed requirements for exercise sessions are
located in the command fitness section of the Operating Guide on
the Physical Readiness Program Web site:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/physical/Pages/default2.aspx.
    2. Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA). The Navy assesses
personal physical fitness via a semi-annual PFA (see enclosure
(1)). The PFA includes a medical screen, a body composition
assessment (BCA) and physical readiness test (PRT) (see
enclosure (1)). The medical screening includes the annual
periodic health assessment (PHA), a semi-annual NAVPERS 6110/3
Physical Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire (PARFQ), and prephysical activity questions (see enclosure (1)). The BCA is
based upon height and weight tables and circumference
measurements, when required. The PRT is a series of physical
events that assess cardio-respiratory fitness, muscular
strength, and endurance. Physical fitness standards should be
maintained constantly and consistently, not solely at the time
of semi-annual testing.
    3. Failure to Meet PFA Standards. Meeting minimum PFA
standards are a condition of continued naval service. Members
with PFA failures will be subject to administrative actions.
Members failing to meet BCA or PRT standards shall participate
in an FEP. Members failing to meet PFA standards two times in
the most recent 3-year period shall be processed for
administrative separation (ADSEP) from the Navy.  The following
conditions on ADSEP processing apply throughout this instruction:
        1. A BCA failure in Cycle 2 2015 **ONLY** will not
cause an overall PFA cycle failure.
        2. All PFA cycle failures prior to 1 January 2016
combined, will only count as a single combined PFA failure.
    4. Medical Waiver Management. Members with two consecutive
medical waivers or three in a 4-year period shall be referred to
the military treatment facility (MTF) for a medical evaluation
board (MEB). MEB findings shall be forwarded to Navy Personnel
Command (NAVPERSCOM), Career Progression Department (PERS-8) for
disposition.

# PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT (PFA) POLICY GUIDELINES

1. PFA. The PFA consists of a medical screening, BCA, and PRT.
To facilitate operational commitments or mission requirements, a
command may conduct an official PFA anytime within each Navy PFA
cycle providing there is a minimum of 4 months between PFAs and
only one per Navy cycle. The command PFA cycle is determined by
the CO to include the regular and make-up dates for PFA
components.
    1. Failing the BCA portion of the PFA is an overall PFA
failure.
        1. Note: For the Cycle 2 2015 **ONLY**, a BCA failure will not
count as a PFA failure (the BCA must still be performed and
recorded).  Sailors who fail the BCA during Cycle 2 2015 will be
enrolled in the FEP and provided nutritional counseling.
2. CO Authority. The CO has authority over the schedule,
conduct, safety, and medical waivers for the PFA.
    1. The Physical Readiness Program requires the completion
of a 1.5 mile run or walk, the definitive assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness. The CO and or OIC may authorize
participation in PFA approved alternative cardio-respiratory
events.
    2. The CO may waive the PRT component of the official PFA
for the entire command based upon deployment and operational
(“DEP/OP”) commitments. Additional reasons for nonparticipation are listed in paragraph 6.
    3. The CO must request approval from the ISIC to “DEP/OP”
BCA for the command.
    4. Waiving more than two consecutive PRT cycles for
“DEP/OP” for the entire command requires concurrence from the
echelon 3 commander via the ISIC.
    5. The CO, using “Bad Day” guidelines, may authorize one
retest on the PRT portion of the PFA (see enclosure (5)).
    6. At the end of each PFA cycle, the CO has authority to
determine whether non-participation was authorized or
unauthorized. All unauthorized non-participation shall be
designated as “UA” in PRIMS and scored a PFA failure.
    7. COs will conduct PFA spot checks. BCA and PRT failures
incurred during a spot check are not counted when determining
whether processing for ADSEP is required, but may result in FEP
enrollment at the CO's discretion.
3. PFA Notification. The command shall provide a notification
at least 10 weeks in advance of scheduled PFA dates. This
notification is intended for the preparations required by the
CFL and for medical screening of members. It is not intended as
a “preparation window” for individuals. Navy personnel are not
exempt from taking the PFA if they did not receive a PFA
notification as long as they are medically cleared and
acclimatized, per paragraph 6b(2)(b).
4. PFA Participation. Participation in the semi-annual PFA is
required for all Active Duty and Drilling Reservists, regardless
of gender, age, rank, title, billet, or retirement request
status.
    1.  All members are required to participate in one PFA per
cycle. PFA cycles are defined as:
        1. Cycle 1 (1 January through 30 June).
        2. Cycle 2 (1 July through 31 December).
    2. PFAs for the current cycle must be completed within the
cycle dates. PFAs may not be conducted after the cycle and
entered as the previous cycle.
    3. See paragraph 6 for authorized non-participation.
    4. No member shall participate in the PRT without medical
clearance. PRT medical clearance requires:
        1. Periodic Health Assessment (PHA). A PHA is an annual
requirement (reference (g)). Members who do not have a current
PHA shall not participate in a PRT or physical conditioning.
            1. Sailors requiring a deployment health assessment (DHA)
must be within the periodicity of their deployment assessment
(post-deployment health assessment (PDHA) or post-deployment
health re-assessment (PDHRA) as appropriate) to participate in
the PRT.
            2. If a PFA (BCA and PRT) is not completed due to
a delinquent PHA or DHA, the member's CO may assign them a
"UA" status in PRIMS for the missed PFA.
        2. NAVPERS 6110/3. All personnel shall complete a
NAVPERS 6110/3 via PRIMS as soon as possible following the PFA
notification.  However the NAVPERS 6110/3 is not required if
the PRT will not be performed (e.g. DEP/OP, IA, TAD, etc.).
        3. Pre-physical activity questions. The CFL shall
ensure every member is asked the questions prior to
participating in the PRT (see paragraph 8).
        4. Failing the BCA does not result in loss of medical
clearance. Sailors will participate in the PRT if medically
cleared to do so (see paragraph 5), unless otherwise exempted.
5. Medical Clearance. Members who respond “yes” to one or more
of the pre-physical activity questions (except question one)
shall be referred to the AMDR for medical clearance. PFA medical
clearance for participation in the PFA will be annotated on a
NAVMED 6110/4 Physical Fitness Assessment Medical Clearance/
Waiver provided in PRIMS or from the medical department.
    1. AMDR Review. Only AMDRs are authorized to make PFA
medical recommendations to the CO. AMDRs shall be a physician,
adult nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or IDC and shall
be appointed in writing.
    2. AMDR Recommendation. The AMDR shall review all NAVPERS
6110/3s with “yes” responses and make appropriate recommendations
via a NAVMED 6110/4. The medical department will file a copy of
the NAVMED 6110/4 in the member’s medical record.
    3. PFA Medical Waivers. Individuals who receive a BCA or
PRT medical waiver for two consecutive PFA cycles or three in
the most recent 4-year period shall be referred to the MTF for a
medical board (MEDBOARD). The medical board findings shall be
referred to NAVPERSCOM (PERS-8) for disposition (enclosures (4)
and (5)).
6. Authorized PFA Non-participation. Personnel who fail the
PFA, and are subsequently granted a medical waiver for
subsequent cycles, remain a PFA failure until completing and
passing an official PFA. The following are the only authorized
medical and non-medical exceptions for not participating in the
PFA:
    1. Exceptions for Medical Reasons. Medically waived status
does not count as a failure or pass for the PFA and will not be
used to count towards such for administrative, promotion, or
retention purposes. In all cases, the Service member’s CO is
the final authority for granting all PFA medical waivers, and
all medical waivers shall be approved prior to the BCA,
recorded in PRIMS, and will be filed
in the member’s medical record consistent with the paragraphs
below:
        1. BCA Medical Waivers. Members must address potential
medical circumstances affecting accurate measurement prior to
the official BCA. After-the-fact BCA waivers are not
authorized. BCA waivers may be granted only if the member is in
approved limited duty (LIMDU) status (ACC 105) for the medical
condition prompting the BCA waiver request, and only under the
following circumstances:
            1. BCA waivers may be granted in the setting of an
inability to obtain an accurate weight (e.g., leg cast) or
measurement (e.g., recent surgery on an area directly involved
with the measurements used to calculate BCA).
            2. BCA waivers may also be granted if the member
has fallen out of BCA standards within the preceding 6 months
due to a medical condition or medical therapy which has been
newly diagnosed, worsened in severity, or increased in dosage in
that 6 month period, which is known to result in weight gain.
            3. The inability to exercise is not a valid reason
for a BCA waiver.
            4. All BCA medical waivers will be issued on a
NAVMED 6110/4 and will require two signatures:
                1. The physician (military or civilian)
recommending the waiver; and
                2.  AMDR physician.
                3. If the AMDR is the recommending physician,
the AMDRs supervisor's signature is required.
        2. PRT Medical Waivers. AMDRs may make a
recommendation to the CO to medically waive all or a portion of
the PRT for an individual.
        3. Pregnancy Status. For the purpose of this
instruction, pregnancy status is defined from the time pregnancy
is confirmed by a military health care provider (HCP) or
civilian HCP in cases of inaccessibility to an MTF, until the
end of the 6 months following convalescent leave (postpartum):
            1. Pregnant Service women will not be issued
medical waivers. ”Pregnant Status” will be assigned in PRIMS.
PFA results prior to confirmation of pregnancy shall not change.
            2. Pregnancy-status Service women shall not be
required to meet BCA and PRT standards.
            3. Per reference (h), pregnant Service women in a
pregnancy status shall receive guidance from a physician, adult
nurse practitioner, or physician assistant concerning type(s)
and duration(s) of activities (e.g., walking, water aerobics,
elliptical, stationary bicycling) to maintain appropriate
physical conditioning and body composition. Pregnancy-status
Service women will not be mandated to participate in command or
unit PT or FEP.
            4. AMDRs shall indicate when pregnant Service
women, who have been removed from a pregnancy status, can
participate in the BCA, PRT, or PT. COs may place personnel
removed from a pregnancy status into the FEP to assist those
members with preparing for the PFA, provided they are medically
cleared.
            5. See reference (h) for policy regarding medical
waivers and PFA exemptions for Service women undergoing
infertility treatment with in vitro fertilization.
    2. Exceptions for Other Reasons. Circumstances exits in
which participation in the PFA, as required by this instruction,
may not be possible. The CO may waive PRT participation for
circumstances. Justification for approved non-participation
shall be entered into PRIMS and will not be considered a PFA
failure. A full list of authorized non-participation reasons
are listed below:
        1. “DEP/OP.” For deployed units where conducting a PRT
is impractical, however BCA is still required.
        2. Excused. The reporting senior of the member must
submit a PFA non-participation letter to OPNAV (N135F) to
designate “excused” non-participation in PRIMS:
            1. Isolated Duty. For members assigned to
non-military organizations such as embassies, “one-of-a-kind”
duty such as the Personnel Exchange Program, or a joint command
without an available qualified CFL or Service equivalent.
            2. Acclimatization. No single policy can be
developed to fit every circumstance regarding the need for
acclimatization of newly-reported personnel. COs are
authorized, with AMDRs consultation, to set appropriate
acclimatization periods for newly-reported personnel for
participation in command or unit PT, PFAs and FEP. In the event
the acclimatization period extends into a new PFA cycle, the
member shall participate in the BCA and the PRIMS record for the
PRT shall reflect “excused.”
        3. Individual Augmentee (IA). Due to the nature of IA
assignments, IAs may be designated in PRIMS as "IA"
participation status if either the BCA, PRT, or both were not
completed due to conditions at the deployed location, such as
safety or the nature of the assignment. Note: Per NAVADMIN
160/08, an IA is defined as any member in receipt of individual
deployment orders issued by NAVPERSCOM, Career Management
Department (PERS-4), to include individual augmentee manpower
management (IAMM), global war on terrorism support assignments
(GSA), overseas contingency operations support assignment (OSA),
and mobilized reserve personnel (RC MOB) not mobilized as part
of an established commissioned reserve component unit, and
health services augment personnel (HSAP). Individuals in such
assignments will be treated as newly reported personnel upon
return and are expected to meet Navy standards for physical
fitness and military appearance.
        4. Temporary Additional Duty. May be used for
consecutive schools lasting less than 10 weeks in duration or
temporary duty assignment with no means of participating in an
official PFA for entire PFA cycle.
        5. Leave. May be used for convalescent leave and
emergency leave which extends beyond the command and Navy PFA
cycle (not intended for regular or leave in conjunction with
permanent changes of station orders).
7. BCA. The BCA portion of the PFA is passed (within BCA
standards) when a member is within established Navy body
composition assessment standards.
    1. BCA Standards. Navy body composition standards are
determined by a three step process.
        1. Apply the maximum weight for height standards in
enclosure (3). If an individual is within the maximum weight
for their height, they have passed the BCA and the remaining steps
are skipped.
        2. Apply a single-site abdominal circumference measurement,
to screen for individuals at increased risk of health problems such
as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.  If an individual's abdominal
circumference measurement is less than or equal to
39.0 inches (for males) or 35.5 inches (for females), they have
passed the BCA and the remaining step is skipped.
        3. Otherwise, the body circumference technique shall be used per the
Operating Guide to determine body fat percentage. PRIMS is the official
source to determine the percent fat estimate for members.
The BCA tables contained in the Operating Guide may be used as an
on-site reference. Individuals within the Department of Defense (DoD)
maximum of less than or equal to 26 percent body fat (for males) or
36 percent body fat (for females) have passed the BCA.  Members whose
BCA is performed using this technique will be enrolled in FEP even if
passing the BCA, unless their body fat percentage is within the
following maximum allowable Navy body fat limits:
        - Male (age 17-21): 22%
        - Male (age 22-29): 23%
        - Male (age 30-39): 24%
        - Male (age 40+): 26%
        - Female (age 17-21): 33%
        - Female (age 22-29): 34%
        - Female (age 30-39): 35%
        - Female (age 40+): 36%
    2. Sailors who fail the BCA shall be evaluated by a medical provider, enrolled
in FEP, and provided nutritional counseling.
    3. COs and officers in charge should specify the required
uniform - uniform of the day or Navy physical training uniform that will be worn during official and unofficial height and
weight screening and circumference measurements.
    4. Official BCA. An official BCA is a BCA conducted during
the command PFA cycle or after the command PFA cycle for members
without a PFA record for the current cycle.
        1. One-on-one BCAs are not authorized. A CFL or
trained ACFL and trained observer must be present;
        2. Only a designated and certified CFL or trained ACFL
can administer the BCA for an official PFA, except as noted
below; and
        3. In the event a member is assigned to a joint command
without a Navy CO or CFL, the official Navy PFA may be conducted
by the CFL-equivalent of the sponsoring Military Service using
Navy criteria and procedures. The CFL-equivalent will forward
PFA data to OPNAV (N135F) for entry into PRIMS.
    5. Unofficial BCA. A check-in or courtesy BCA is a
proactive measure to assist members in consistently meeting BCA
standards. Check-in and courtesy BCAs shall not be used as an
official BCA, unless the measurement occurs after the command
PFA cycle and no current PFA record exists.
    6. Non-authorized BCA. For the official PFA, measurements
taken by medical department personnel, civilian doctors, MWR
fitness staff, or any other person are not authorized and shall
not override the BCA taken by the CFL or ACFL.
    7. BCA Participation. The BCA shall be accomplished on
every member even if the PRT component of the PFA is “DEP/OP.”
Command-wide “DEP/OP” for BCA must be approved by the ISIC (for
individual exemptions, refer to paragraph 6).
    8. BCA Scheduling Requirements for AC. The BCA shall be
completed within 45 days of, but not less than 24 hours, prior
to participation in the PRT.
    9. BCA Scheduling Requirements for Drilling Reservists.
Drilling Reservists shall strive to comply with the BCA
requirements of paragraph 6b, but have up to 31 days from the
time they complete the BCA to conduct the PRT. Reservists shall
not conduct a BCA less than 24 hours prior to the PRT.
    10. Altering BCA measurements. Any attempt by a member to
alter their BCA measurements by using body wraps, starvation
diets, and sauna suits is prohibited. If temporary altering is
detected by the command, the CFL or the ACFL, the member shall
be required to wait a minimum of 72 hours before completing the
official BCA measurement. Any attempt to influence the BCA
measurement through intimidation, coercion, or other means may
result in disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice.
8. PRT. The PRT is passed when a member scores satisfactory or
above in all events.
    1. Administration. The PRT shall only be administered by
designated and certified CFLs and trained ACFLs. All personnel
participating in the PRT shall wear Navy PTU.
    2. Participation. The member must be medically cleared to
participate in the PRT.
    3. Alternate Cardio Events. The swim, elliptical and bike
are alternate cardio events. Participation in an alternative
cardio-respiratory event is not an entitlement. The
Operating Guide provides detailed information on the use and
testing procedures for the cardio-respiratory alternative
events.
    4. Scoring. Each PRT event is scored for five levels of
performance and assigned points based on performance (enclosure
(3)) (points from each event are added together and divided by
three to determine the overall score):
        1. Outstanding:90 to 100 points;
        2. Excellent:  75 to 89 points;
        3. Good:       60 to 74 points;
        4. Satisfactory:45 to 59 points; and
        5. Failure:     44 points or below.
    5. Personnel at Increased Elevation. Members permanently
assigned to locations at increased elevation shall participate
in the PRT per the Operating Guide. Increased elevation is
defined as greater than or equal to 5,000 feet above sea level
only:
        1. PRT events completed at altitudes of 5,000 feet or
higher shall use adjusted tables located in the Operating Guide;
and
        2. Other than using adjusted tables, PFA procedures are
not modified due to increased elevation nor do COs have any
authority to modify other components of the requirements.
    6. Pre-physical Activity Questions. Any members with
positive responses to any of the below questions (except
question one), must be evaluated by an AMDR before participating
in the PRT. The CFL will make a determination if further
medical evaluation is necessary. The pre-physical activity
questions are:
        1. Do you have a current PHA?  If no, you may not
participate today.
        2. Do you have chest pain (with or without exertion),
bone or joint pain, high blood pressure or high cholesterol? If
yes, have you been cleared, by your medical provider, to
participate in PT?
        3. Have you had a change in your medical status since
the last time you were asked these questions?
        4. Are you ill today or know of any medical condition
that may prevent you from participating in physical activity
today?
        5. (For PRT Only) Did you answer yes to any NAVPERS
6110/3 questions? If yes, do you have a PFA medical waiver or
clearance form on file? If no you may not participate today?
    7. PRT Safety Guidelines. Participation in physical
activity, even those related to improving health status, pose a
risk of injury. Environment and characteristics of participants
also contributes to overall injury risk. Members must be
informed of these risks and taught how to minimize the
possibility of injury:
        1. The CFL is responsible for conducting a safe PRT and
shall complete the PFA checklist in the Operating Guide. All
events of the PRT shall be performed per the Operating Guide.
        2. One-on-one PRT are not authorized. Every PRT must
have a CFL or ACFL and one qualified CPR monitor present per
every 25 participants.
        3. All PRTs shall begin with the pre-physical activity
questions to determine whether there have been any changes in
medical status since completion of the NAVPERS 6110/3.
        4. The CFL or ACFL will lead the participants in a 5 to
10 minute dynamic warm-up. Appropriate exercises are described
in the Operating Guide.
        5. All PRT events shall be completed on the same day,
and in the following sequence: warm-up, curl-ups, push-ups,
cardio-respiratory event (run or walk, swim, elliptical trainer
or stationary bike), and cool-down.
        6. Following completion of the PRT events, the CFL or
ACFL shall ensure participants perform recommended cool-down
exercises and sign the official PRT score sheet.
9.  PFA Status
    1.  PFA is passed when a member passes both the BCA and the
PRT.
    2. When the BCA is “passed” and one or more PRT event is
medically waived, the overall score of the PFA is “partial
pass.”
    3. When the BCA is “passed” and the entire PRT has been
exempt due to an authorized non-participation reason, the
overall score of the PFA is “BCA pass.”
    4. The PFA is a failure when the BCA or any PRT event is
failed.
10. Data Reporting. PRIMS is the only approved means of
organizing and documenting information including the results of
medical screening and waivers. All data for a PFA semi-annual
cycle including waivers and justification for non-participation,
shall be entered into PRIMS within 30 days of completion of the
command’s PFA cycle. Data entered must match the cycle in which
the PFA was conducted. Each command is responsible for tracking
PFA results via PRIMS and taking appropriate administrative
action.
    1. CFLs have up to 60 days from test date to edit existing
PFA records.
    2. All AC and RC personnel are responsible for reviewing
their PRIMS data within 60 days after each PFA cycle, as it may
impact promotion, retention, transfer, or selection status.
11. PRIMS Corrections. Requests to correct PRIMS data must be
submitted to OPNAV (N135F) within 1-year of occurrence. The
request must be sent via a LOC from the originating command,
along with supporting documentation. Examples of required
documentation are available on the Physical Readiness Program
Web site:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/physical/Pages/default2.aspx.

# PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT (PFA) FAILURE PROCESS

1. PFA Failures. A failure of either the BCA or PRT component
of the PFA constitutes a PFA failure. In the event a medical
waiver is granted for all or part of the PRT, members must still
pass the BCA component unless it is also medically waived.
Members failing the BCA component for the first time or
receiving a new failure in a 4-year period shall be referred to
medical for evaluation for clearance to participate in command
or unit PT or FEP.
    1. “Bad Day.” A CO may authorize one retest to pass the
PRT portion of the current PFA cycle:
        1. An individual must request a “Bad Day” within 24
hours of completing the PRT. If approved, the retest must be
administered within 7 days of the initial PRT failure and within
the same PFA cycle for which the “Bad Day” was requested.
Drilling Reservists have until the end the following month;
        2. The member must retake all components of the PRT.
The “Bad Day” option does not apply to BCA determinations; and
        3. If the individual is approved for a “Bad Day” but
does not participate in the retest, becomes “medically waived”
before the retest, or transfers to another assignment before the
retest, the initial test score is to be entered into PRIMS as
the official PFA.
    2. PFA Failure Notification. Documentation of written
counseling provided any time prior to member acquiring a second PFA
failure is sufficient notice for all administrative actions
specified in this instruction.
        1. Enlisted PFA Failure Notification. COs will provide
enlisted personnel failing the PFA a written notification of the
failure within 30 days following the completion of the command
PFA cycle. Per reference (e), notification shall be in the form
of at least one NAVPERS 1070/613.
        2. Officer PFA Failure Notification. COs will provide
officers a LON within 30 days following the completion of the
command PFA cycle.
    3. Assignment to FEP. FEP is mandatory for any member who
fails any portion of the PFA, or when assigned by the CO. All
Sailors in FEP will participate in a mock PFA every 30 days.
Failures incurred during a mock PFA will not count as official
failures. Participation in FEP shall continue until the member
passes the PRT and is within BCA standards. Members assigned
to FEP due to BCA failure shall also be enrolled in nutritional
counseling.
    4. Fitness Reports and Performance Evaluations. PFA
failures shall be reported in fitness reports and performance
evaluations as directed by reference (d).
    5. Enlisted Advancements. Enlisted members shall have
advancement or frocking deferred if they have failed the most
recent official PFA. In the circumstances where a “special PFA”
is required for frocking and promotion purposes (i.e., chief
petty officer induction), the command shall defer frocking for
members that fail to meet Navy PFA standards. Members may
participate in monthly FEP PFA to regain eligibility. If not
within standards by promotion cycle limiting date, the
advancement authority will be withdrawn, per reference (i).
    6. Officer Promotions. Officers shall be ineligible for
promotion if they have failed the most recent PFA. Reference
(j) outlines requirements for a CO to forward notification of
failure to delay promotion to NAVPERSCOM, Officer Performance
and Separation Branch (PERS-834). Members may regain
eligibility by passing the next command directed PFA (i.e.,
monthly FEP mock PFA) and notification shall again be made to
NAVPERSCOM (PERS-834).
    7. Reenlistment and Extension. AC members who have two
or more PFA failures in the most recent 3-year period shall not
be reenlisted or extended. Requests for exceptions to policy
for active duty reenlistments or extensions shall be addressed
to NAVPERSCOM, Active Enlisted Programs Branch (PERS-811), via
the chain of command. Requests for exceptions to reenlistment
or extension policy for Reservists should be addressed to
NAVPERSCOM, Reserve Enlisted Status Branch (PERS-913), via the
chain of command.
    8. Transfers. AC and Full Time Support (FTS) personnel who
have two or more PFA failures in the most recent 3-year period
shall not transfer to a new permanent duty station and will be
retained onboard. This restriction also applies to those who
have waivers for readiness.
        1. Requests for exceptions for active duty transfers
shall be addressed to NAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) via the chain of
command. A template for transfer waiver requests can be found
on the Physical Readiness Program Web site:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/physical/Pages/default2.aspx;
        2. Transfers will continue to be authorized for
Drilling Reservists who, due to a change in residence or unit
disestablishment, are no longer within reasonable commuting
distance from a reserve unit, as defined in reference (k);
        3. Unless the most recent PFA was passed, Drilling
Reservists who have failed two consecutive PFAs in the past 3
years shall not be assigned to IAMM assignments;
        4. AC and FTS personnel who have failed the two most
recent PFAs consecutively shall not transfer to a new permanent
duty station until the member successfully passes a PFA during
an official PFA cycle; and
        5. Unless the most recent PFA was passed, AC personnel
who have failed two PFAs in the past 3 years shall not be
assigned to:
            1. Overseas billets;
            2. GSA/OSA;
            3. IAMM assignments;
            4. Pre-commissioning billets;
            5. Recruiting division commander assignments;
            6. Recruiting duty;
            7. Equal opportunity advisor assignments;
            8. Washington DC and Millington staffs;
            9. Combatant commander staff; or
            10. Instructor duty.
    9. Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. OPNAV (N133) is the
single point of contact on all PFA failure policy matters
relating to Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program personnel. All
community management and policy decisions affecting Naval
Nuclear Propulsion Program personnel must be submitted to OPNAV
(N133) for review and approval vice NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811). This
includes waivers for readiness, ADSEPs, reenlistments and
extensions, and transfers.
    10. Medical Officers. All community management and policy
decisions affecting medical officers must be referred to BUMED,
Total Force Directorate (M1) for review and approval.
2. ADSEP. Mandatory separation processing shall occur for all
members who fail two PFA cycles in the most recent 3-year
period. Refer to reference (e) for enlisted and reference (f)
for officer processing requirements.
    1. ADSEP for Over 18 Years of Service. Members with over
18 years of service are not exempt from ADSEP.
    2. RC Personnel. RC personnel who have two or more PFA
failures in the most recent 3-year period shall not be
transferred to the Inactive Ready Reserve in lieu of ADSEP
processing:
        1. This restriction applies to Drilling Reservists and
RC personnel who are being released from all types of active
duty for operational support orders (temporary active duty
recalls, voluntary mobilization and active duty for special work
orders) and IAMM assignments; and
        2. Requests for exception to this policy should be
addressed to NAVPERSCOM (PERS-9) via the chain of command.
    3. Waiver for Readiness. A waiver for readiness is a
waiver of ADSEP processing and is granted for a specific PFA
cycle only. The waiver is designed to address the adverse
effect on unit, fleet, or community that would result from the
loss of a specific individual:
        1. COs must request a waiver for readiness through
their ISIC. Echelon 3 (or higher) commanders maintain
responsibility for approval and disposition of all waivers for
readiness. Command requests must be initiated within 14 days of
the end of the command PFA cycle. Approving commanders will
consult with the appropriate BUPERS (BUPERS-31/32) before making
a final determination on waiver approval.
        2. A waiver for readiness expires at either completion
of obligated service, or at the completion of the next PFA cycle
(whichever occurs first). If, upon waiver expiration, the
member still has two or more PFA failures in the most recent
3-year period, COs shall initiate ADSEP processing per
references (e) and (f) or request renewal of the waiver for
readiness.
        3. Individuals with waivers for readiness will not be
transferred (without transfer waiver), reenlisted, or extended.
        4. A waiver for readiness does not excuse an individual
from participation in the PFA nor will it change existing data
in PRIMS.
3. Retention Following an ADSEP Board. Individuals retained in
the Navy following COMNAVPERSCOM approval of the ADSEP board
recommendation are eligible to transfer to billets other than
those listed in paragraph 1h(d), however, the individuals will
need a transfer waiver from NAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) prior to
transfer. Individuals will be referred to an additional ADSEP
board if they fail a subsequent PFA and still have two or more
PFA failures in the most recent 3-year period.
