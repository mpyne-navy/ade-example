# FRD

## General

1.  ADE should definitely do the thing.
2.  ADE should do the one thing, but not the other thing.
3.  ADE must comply with applicable laws/regulations/policys (LRPs) for all the things.
4.  ADE SHALL provide an Enterprise Functional Widget Factory (EFWF).

## Informative

For lack of a better place to put, this is where we document all the ways we envision ADE doing the things it
is supposed to do, that aren't really a "functional" need.

### Awesomeness

1.  ADE should be:
    1. super fast,
    2. "Web scale",
    3. cloud-enabled, and
    4. 100% artisanally buzzword-compliant.
